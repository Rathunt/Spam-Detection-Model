# Spam-Detection-Model
A test model to predict spam messages from a dataset of text messages.

# Getting Started
The brief of this project was to create an understandable and simple tutorial for collegues joining Cognitive Sciences to better understand Machine Learning models through a relatable application of Data Science. The notebooks in the project document my own learning as well.
